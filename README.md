Project 1 @42
You establish your first library. It's fantastic if you recall the piscine's concepts because it employs many of them.
If not, it's still beneficial to refresh them with the videos available in the intra portal (if you're a student at 42).
Alternatively, you could also watch the videos listed below:

 1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJgsSFOSQv0 (video covering basics of C)
 2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ybLD6_2gKM (video covering pointers)
 3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr__k1drynY (just a bonus video which is worth a watch)
 
Websites that can assist you with a variety of functions include:
 1. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
 2. https://aticleworld.com/
 3. https://pythontutor.com/ (for visualizing your code)
 
 There are quite some restrictions for 42 students to comply with while writing the code but if you're not a 42 student
 then you're technically not required to adhere to them but for the sake of challenge I would recommend doing the project
 with the restrictions.
